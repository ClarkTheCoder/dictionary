[Hackterms](https://www.hackterms.com) is a crowdsourced dictionary of coding terms. Use it to quickly learn about a tool, platform, language, library, or process - how it fits into the coding ecosystem, why people use it, what the alternatives are.

On Hackterms, your fellow devs will teach you when, where, and why - but now how - a certain tool or process is used.
